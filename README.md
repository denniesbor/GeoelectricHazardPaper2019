This repository contains the code used to produce the results in the paper.

## Notes

I have created a package called bezpy, which I make heavy use of here to manipulate all of the data. It can be found here, along with installation instructions: [bezpy](https://github.com/greglucas/bezpy)

For Spherical Elementary Current Systems (SECS) I created my own Python version of vectorized SECS: [pySECS](https://github.com/greglucas/pySECS)
